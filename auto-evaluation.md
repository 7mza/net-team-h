#### Recap
Team Member | Time spent | Parts worked on |
:--- | :--- | :---
AMYAR Amine | around 20h | Player, Util
BAAZIZ Hamza | around 30h | Player, Hub, Mina, Spring Shell
BENDARI Yassin | around 20h | Hub, Spring Shell

#### Followed good dev practices

###### Major
- Hub and Player were seperated into two projects
- All classes are loosely decoupled
- Spring was used for dependency injection
- Spring Shell was used for user interaction

###### Minor
- maven was used to unify the architecture and handle dependencies
- .gitgnore was used to ignore IDE, tools & packaging  generated file : only source code is versionned
- code was formatted using IDE built in formatting tool
- camelCase was respected
- global static variable are only used for constants
